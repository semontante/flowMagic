\usage{
get_train_data(paths_file = NULL, df_paths = NULL, n_cores = 1,
  prop_down = NULL, remove_class = NULL, n_points_per_plot = NULL,
  normalize_data = T, vec_col = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{paths_file}{Vector of paths. Each path points toward a single csv file containin training info (labels and bivariate expression). paths_file can be also directly the list of dataframes containing labels and bivariate expression.}

\item{df_paths}{Dataframe containing the paths of file to read. The paths to data must be in the first column. The associated paths to classes are in second column.}

\item{n_cores}{Number of cores. Default to 1.}

\item{prop_down}{Proportion of events (downsampling). Default to NULL (downsampling using number of points).}

\item{remove_class}{Vector of classes to ignore. Default to NULL.}

\item{n_points_per_plot}{Number of points for downsampling.}

\item{normalize_data}{If True, data is normalized to 0-1 range. Default to True.}

\item{vec_col}{vector of columns names if the input dataframes have more than 3 columns. The third column name must always refer to the column with the gate label of each event. Default to NULL.}
}
\value{
Dataframe.
