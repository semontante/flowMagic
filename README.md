Welcome to the flowMagic github repository! 

flowMagic is an automated gating tool designed to automate the gating of bivariate flow cytometry (FCM) data. 
The flowMagic algorithm is the first algorithm trained on a large dataset of gated bivariate FCM data generated by the players of EVE Online, the online role-playing game developed by the CCP Games company.

# Overview

Flow cytometry (FCM) is a technology widely used in immunology and cell biology to enable the precise identification and quantification of heterogeneous cell populations across diverse applications. The prevailing analysis approach, termed gating, relies on expert manual analysis of hierarchical bivariate plots.  This is a subjective and time-consuming approach that generate inconsistent results. In order to generate a large high quality training dataset in a relatively short amount of time, we recruited the players of EVE Online to gate milions of bivariate FCM plots within the mini-game Project Discovery. The flowMagic algorithm, trained on this large diverse dataset, represents a significant advancement in ML-based analysis of FCM data, combining citizen science and machine learning to develop more robust, generalizable automated FCM analysis tools.

# import data without labels
list_test_data<-import_test_set_csv(path_data = path_dir,n_cores = 1)
# Note that it is possible to provide also directly the paths to each file. See functions manual for additional
details.
# data preprocessing to generate the template model using first file as template
ref_train<-get_train_data(paths_file = list_data_ref[1],n_cores = 1) # we select first element of the imported list
of dataframes
# generate template model using out-of-the-bag validation
ref_model_info<-magicTrain(df_train = ref_train,n_cores = 1,train_model = "rf")
# perform automated gating (gates boundaries prediction step)
list_dfs_pred<-magicPred_all(list_test_data = list_test_data,magic_model = NULL,ref_data_train = ref_train,
ref_model_info = ref_model_info,n_cores = 8)
# Note that providing the training set is optional (ref_data_train = ref_train is optional).
# Providing the training set allows the user to calculate the target-template distance for each plot to analyze.
# list_dfs_pred contains a list of dataframes for each plot analyzed. In other words, it is a nested list (e.g.,
# downsampled dataset and original dataset with predicted labels for each plot). See the functions manual for the
# full list of dataframes returned.
# visualize gated data
df_temp<-list_dfs_pred[[1]] $ df_test_original # dataframe of first gated plot
magicPlot(df = df_temp,type = "ML",size_points = 1)
magicPlot(df = df_temp,type = "dens",size_points = 1)
