# flowMagic 

Welcome to the flowMagic github repository! 

flowMagic is an automated gating tool designed to automate the gating of bivariate flow cytometry (FCM) data. 
The flowMagic algorithm is the first algorithm trained on a large dataset of gated bivariate FCM data generated by the players of EVE Online, the online role-playing game developed by the CCP Games company.




# Overview

Flow cytometry (FCM) is a technology widely used in immunology and cell biology to enable the precise identification and quantification of heterogeneous cell populations across diverse applications. The prevailing analysis approach, termed gating, relies on expert manual analysis of hierarchical bivariate plots.  This is a subjective and time-consuming approach that generate inconsistent results. In order to generate a large high quality training dataset in a relatively short amount of time, we recruited the players of EVE Online to gate milions of bivariate FCM plots within the mini-game Project Discovery. The flowMagic algorithm, trained on this large diverse dataset, represents a significant advancement in ML-based analysis of FCM data, combining citizen science and machine learning to develop more robust, generalizable automated FCM analysis tools.
